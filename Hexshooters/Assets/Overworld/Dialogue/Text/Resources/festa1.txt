#Coleman/normal/Alright Greenhorn, so you-#Matt/normal/Matthew, Mr. Kanatcher. I mean, call me Matt. Sir.#John/normal/Who do ya think you are, Greenhorn?! You’re mouthin’ off to Coleman Kanatcher, a top 5 Master Maverick!#Matt/normal/And where do you get off mouthin’ to me, huh? I’m a Maverick too!#John/normal/Why I’ve half a mind to-#Coleman/normal/HEY! I have a whole mind to trounce both of you Greenhorns right here, if’n ya don’t shut yer traps! You are both Mavericks that is true, but you are BOTH the lowest rank of Greenhorn.#Coleman/normal/And clearly y’all need to be reminded of it. John, you’ve been to Scorpion’s Pass before?#John/normal/The valley south of town? Nothin’ there but bandits and scorpions, but a Bounty took me there once.#Matt/normal/Wow, you’ve done a real Bounty before? What was it like?#John/normal/Oh! Well it weren’t too exciting but if’n ya wanna hear the tale, Greenhorn…#Coleman/normal/Plenty of time to shoot the breeze on the trail. You two are going through the Pass.#John/normal/Are ya kiddin’ me?!#Coleman/normal/No. I’ll be hidin’ out somewhere and you two need to work together to find me.#Matt/normal/A tracking Bounty… taken out on yourself? What do we do when we find you?#Coleman/normal/Well that’s when we’ll see if you two are real Mavericks or just a couple of stuffed shirts. Spend some time in town to prepare, and be sure to talk to me if you want some tips on how to shoot.#Matt/normal/I can talk to anyone who’s willin’ to make conversation by pressing the A Button.
