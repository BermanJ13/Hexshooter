#Ernaline R. Eaper/normal/You Greenhorns ever combo’d few bullets together?#Matt/normal/I don’t know what you’re talking about Ma’am since I reckon I haven’t. Mind sharing?#Ernaline R. Eaper/normal/If you use certain bullets in a certain order, you can make quick work of your foes.  Try using a wind spell on that revolver of yours on a burning panel when get the chance. #John/normal/I’m sure he’ll burn the whole west if tell him that. #Matt/normal/Don’t worry I got this.  Thanks for the tip Ma’am.#Ernaline R. Eaper/normal/Hope you guys bring some work for the Undertaker. Might get him to stop talking to me for a bit.
