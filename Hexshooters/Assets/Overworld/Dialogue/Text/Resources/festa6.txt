#Matt/normal/By Gum! That was a lot today. Feel like I’ve been chewing gravel.#John/normal/I can’t believe we actually had a chance to duel a top 5 Master Maverick!#Matt/normal/Not much of a duel if it wasn’t one-on-one though wasn’t it? Besides, I bet he could have bulldozed us completely if he really wanted.#John/normal/Yeah, but we got through it by the skin of our teeth. That means that next time we’ll have cooler hands and cooler heads. After a few bounties, even cooler than that. Who knows, maybe one day we’ll give him a run for his money!#Matt/normal/Maybe one day. For now let’s just focus getting past those bandits and out of this arid scorpion pit.
