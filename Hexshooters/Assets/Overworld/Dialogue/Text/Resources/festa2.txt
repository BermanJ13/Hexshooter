#Coleman/normal/Here to take me up on some hex-slinging tips?#John/normal/Well, the Greenhorn here might need to go over the basics. I’m still sharp as a tack!#Matt/normal/I’m not helpless! I have my Deck of whistlers- uh magic bullets, and I know that at the start of any scrap I need to load them up in the order I want to shoot ‘em in with A.#John/normal/I have my own Deck too, of course. And I can already tell you that if’n you’re unhappy with the order of your whistlers you can press B to unload them.#Coleman/normal/But you know that Matt’s Revolver can change his whistler order during battle with the bumpers, correct?#John/normal/Yeah well, my Shotgun doesn’t need nothin’ so fancy just yet. The same whistlers loaded into my Shotgun will be more powerful and closer range than in the Greenhorn’s puny Revolver.#Matt/normal/Well, if’n ya want to borrow some of my whistlers we’ll just do it through the START menu. Be sure to leave us both even-stevens with 30.#John/normal/Sure and when a scrap gets too heated for you, just tap the X button to switch with me.#Coleman/normal/Sounds like y’all have it covered. Now finish business in town and git! I’ll be in Scorpion’s Pass to the south of town.
